				<p><b>The sitch:</b> While I've always had a love-love relationship with math and numbers,
				I learned early on that this wasn't the case for everyone. Researchers estimate that 25 percent of college students
				have math anxiety. That's a lot of people in the work force who are avoiding math!
				<!-- http://www.psychologicalscience.org/index.php/publications/observer/2014/september-14/nervous-about-numbers.html -->
				
				Armed with a background in education, strong analytical skills, and lots of creativity,
				I began empowering adults to embrace data and its ability to inform decision-making.</p>

				<p><b>Findings:</b></p> 
				<p>Focus on real-life (practical) situations- While working as an instructional designer,
				I developed online educational materials that address common problems and make use
				of relevant data sets. </p><p>add video for clustering</p> http://datasociety.co/courses/clustering-and-finding-patterns/

				<p>Create conversation- Through conversation people can figure out how the new information they've
				learned relates/challenges/improves their current thinking and behavior. Conversation
				has the added bonus of encouraging relationship and community building (which have a whole host of their 
				own benefits. The PPT is an example of how data literacy training can be made interactive.</p>

				<p>add CAEP presentation</p>
				<p>Integrate time for applying new skills</p>Whether adults are working online or in-person, they need to have
				opportunities to practice the new skills they have learned. Guides, training outlines, and other work
				samples are available.

				<p><b>Essential Knowledge and Skills:</b>
					<p><ul>
						<li>Planning - Best practices in adult learning theory, broad understanding of research methods
						and approaches to using data, an eye toward UX</li>
						<li>Tech integration - Video editing, WordPress and proprietary databases, learning management systems, 
						survey development, detail-oriented, advanced Google Apps</li>
						<li>Facilitation - Excellent presentation and communication skills, advanced Microsoft Office and publishing tools,
						ability to think on your feet</li>
					</ul>

			<p><b>Additional Questions:</b><p>How can the challenges facing underserved adults be addressed, so that
			they can become more data literate</p><p>What would be included in a good data pre-assessment?</p>
